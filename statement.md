PROBLEM STATEMENT Different mini Games contains (NUMBER GUESSING),(DICE ROLLING) ,(WATER SNAKE GUN ) is a Python-based interactive game designed for computer and player. The game selects a random word from a predefined list, jumbles the letters, and challenges the players to guess the correct word. The player who correctly identifies the word get a point. The game continues until the players choose to quit

OBJECTIVE To create an engaging word game that improves vocabulary and cognitive skills. To implement basic Python concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, and user input. To practice handling turn-based logic and scoring mechanisms in a multiplayer game.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT This project is a simple Python-based console game hub that allows users to choose and play different mini-games: a number guessing game, a dice rolling game, and a snake-water-gun game. It uses randomization for game logic, provides user interaction through inputs, and continues running until the user decides to exit. It helps users learn basic programming concepts like loops, conditions, and the use of the random module

TRAGET USERS: All the users who are above the age of 12 interested in playing games can use it

HIGH LEVEL FEATURES: Menu-Driven Game Hub A main menu allows users to choose between multiple games or exit.Multiple Mini-Games Included Number Guessing Game Dice Rolling Game Snake-Water-Gun Game Randomized Gameplay Uses Python’s random module to create unpredictable results in each game. Continuous Gameplay Loop Users can play games repeatedly until they choose to exit. Simple Console-Based Interface Clear text instructions make it easy for the user to interact. User Input and Feedback System Provides responses based on the user’s actions and game outcomes.

Beginner-Friendly Structure Shows basic Python concepts like loops, conditions, and functions (expandable).
